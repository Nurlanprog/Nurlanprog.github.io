    The Relationship between Anger and Happiness: An Experience Sampling Study
Mehmet Akif Sensoy
University of Twente
Abstract
This present paper had the purpose of investigating how individuals’ anger and happiness is
associated during their daily life. Therefore, the current paper explored possible relationships
between trait and state levels of anger and happiness of individuals over seven days.
Specifically, trait to trait, trait to state and state to state relationships of anger and happiness.
To measure individuals’ (mostly students) daily experiences over the course of one week, an
online survey with the method of experience sampling was utilised with a sample of 31
mostly German (77% female) young adults (M = 21.25, SD = 1.34). Results of the multilevel
analysis show that state anger and state happiness are negatively related to each other on a
within-person (b = -.29, t(849) = -18.11, p < .001) and between-person level (b = -.43, t(849)
= -31.68, p < .001), while trait anger and trait happiness did not show a relationship. Neither
did trait anger and trait happiness show any significant relationship on state anger or state
happiness. Thus, the findings of the current study indicate that the trait emotions of anger and
happiness are on a separate dimension than the state levels of anger and happiness, implying
that the traits and states of their respective emotion are independent of each other. Results
contribute to the understanding of individuals’ anger and happiness emotions, their
relationship towards each other and their fluctuations, in order to decrease the negative impact
of high anger levels and low happiness levels.

ANGER & HAPPINESS 3
Introduction
Humans experience all kinds of different emotions in their daily lives. In his research
about emotions, Ekman (1992) identified and summarised six basic emotions that are
universal to humans. These universal emotions are happiness, anger, fear, disgust, sadness and
surprise. These emotions manifest in being a permanent trait of a person and as being present
with regard to a state that someone is momentarily in (Larsen & Ketelaar, 1991). Therefore, it
is possible that an individual can experience a wide variety of several emotions over the
course of the day (Silk et al., 2003). Additionally, there is the possibility of experiencing
different emotions simultaneously, by experiencing one emotion, while a second emotion can
be triggered in a specific state (Carrera & Oceja, 2007). For example, a person that thinks
back at the transition time from ending high-school and starting university first feels euphoric
(looking forward to a new life) but then in addition also feels very sad (thinking about missing
old friends) (Carrera & Oceja, 2007).
 Anger and happiness are two universal and important emotions that concern all
humans (Ekman, 1992). One factor regarding their influence in everyday life is their level of
fluctuation. Emotional fluctuation provides an additional understanding about individuals’
emotional lability (Liu et al., 2016) and is also important in understanding the impact of
emotion generally (Chan et al., 2014). Moreover, these fluctuations of emotional experience
over time are associated with impaired levels of mental health, with fluctuations of negative
affect being related to depressive symptoms, borderline personality disorder and suicidal
ideation whereas fluctuations in positive affect being related to lower levels of satisfaction
with life (Chan et al., 2014).
 Especially with findings about possible negative consequences of anger and (lack of)
happiness on our mental health (DiGiuseppe & Tafrate, 2007) and medical conditions (cancer
or coronary artery disease) (Kassinove, 1995), they are an important field of investigation.
Thus, with more knowledge about the relationships between anger and happiness, it is
possible to create interventions targeted towards the better coping of fluctuations of them.
Accordingly, by understanding more about this relationship there would be an approach
towards the increase of positive emotions such as happiness and a decrease of negative
emotions such as anger through deliberate implementation of the results of this study and
through further research.
ANGER & HAPPINESS 4
 This study aims to combine all three trait to trait, trait to state and state to state
assessments in one study regarding anger and happiness. Thus, this would represent a novelty
in this field due to the combination of these assessments. Moreover, this study aims to
contribute to fill the gap in literature regarding the state to state assessment of anger and
happiness. In the following sections happiness and anger will be discussed more in detail to
get a general overview of the two constructs and about previous research on their trait and
state levels. In emotion research, the state-trait model is used to describe two ways on how
individuals experience emotions (Spielberger et al., 1983). A state is referred to a temporary
mood state, whereas a trait represents a stable personality dimension (Abdu et al., 2012).
Anger
 Anger can generally be defined as the emotional state that an individual can
experience, from mild irritation to fury or rage (Butcher et al., 2013). Thus, the emotion of
anger is experienced in higher or lower intensities every day in our lives. Main triggers that
can cause anger are the disconfirmation of expectations, insults and threat to self-esteem and
perceptions of injustice (DiGiuseppe & Froh, 2002). Moreover, anger can increase one’s
optimism regarding success in confrontational situations, which leads to more confidence and
thus more approach behaviours towards risk taking (Gordon et al., 2016).
 Furthermore, in the definition of anger, two types can be distinguished, namely overt
and suppressed anger (Kassinove, 1995). The negative consequences of overt anger are
named to be a negative self-concept, lower self-esteem and verbal and physical assault,
whereas negative consequences of suppressed anger are mostly about medical conditions such
as cancer or coronary artery disease (Kassinove, 1995).
State vs Trait Anger
 Following the state-trait model (Spielberger et al., 1983), state anger is known as the
momentary experience of anger in response to different situations that vary in duration,
intensity and seem so serve as triggers (Quinn et al., 2014). These situations can serve as
triggers for anger due to misinterpretation of them by the individual. Such misinterpretations
develop in individuals high on state anger, which are prone to interpret situations more
negatively and have a decreased perception of positive situations (Gordon et al., 2016). Thus,
such individuals experience negative situations more intense. Furthermore, state anger was
ANGER & HAPPINESS 5
found to strongly correlate with an increase in one’s level of aggression, aggressive behaviour
and risky behaviour (Deffenbacher et al., 2003; Gordon et al., 2016). On the contrary,
individuals that can control and regulate their anger, by using regulation strategies, such as
distraction (Rivers et al., 2006), can have benefits from their anger. One of such benefits is the
pursuit of achieving confrontational goals (Tamir et al., 2008). Also, the level of state anger of
an individual is strongly influenced by the persons level of trait anger, by an increase in the
duration and intensity of a persons state anger when trait anger is high (Quinn et al., 2014).
 Trait anger can be described as a persistent personality type of an individual, which
manifests in easier irritability and more frequent experiences of anger compared to individuals
with lower levels of trait anger (Quinn et al., 2014). Therefore, some people are prone to have
higher trait anger levels whereas others might have lower levels of trait anger (Lievaart et al.,
2016). There are several consequences regarding high levels of trait anger which have been
identified. Individuals with high trait anger have lower self-esteem, perceive lower social
support, are prone to suicidal ideation and alienate greater from school or university (Quinn et
al., 2014). Additionally, higher levels of anger have been associated with mental disorders
such as bipolar disorder, borderline, antisocial personality disorder and paranoid personality
disorder among others (DiGiuseppe & Tafrate, 2007).
Happiness
 Happiness is generally defined as the individuals’ appreciation and satisfaction of the
own life as a whole (Veenhoven, 1989; Tatarkiewicz, 2011). In other words, happiness can be
understood as overall life satisfaction, presence of positive affect and the absence of negative
affect (Demır & Weitekamp, 2006). Furthermore, happiness can be described as the subjective
evaluation of one’s life regarding one’s feelings and emotional outcome (Jalloh et al., 2014).
The happiness set point, circumstances, and intentional activities of an individual are three
factors that precede its level of happiness (Lyubomisky et al., 2005). The happiness set point
refers to fixed and stable genetic preconditions, the circumstances refer to demographic (e.g.
gender), geographic (e.g. residence), and contextual (e.g. culture) factors and intentional
activities refer to voluntary, effortful activities that sustain one’s level of happiness
(Lyubomisky et al., 2005).
ANGER & HAPPINESS 6
 Moreover, elevated happiness levels come with some positive consequences on
individuals’ lives. For instance, lower levels of stress (Schiffrin & Nelson, 2010) due to more
adaptive coping styles (Rim, 1993), improved social skills (Argyle & Lu, 1990) and enhanced
productivity (Oswald et al., 2015). Additionally, individuals experiencing much positive affect
have elevated levels of extraversion, activity, enthusiasm and cooperation, whereas high
satisfaction with life is linked to being warm, having a positive self view and not being
anxious or critical in interpersonal relations (Emmons & Diener, 1985).
State vs Trait Happiness
 When it comes to happiness, there is also state-and trait-like happiness that needs to be
taken into account. State happiness refers to the situational elevation in the experience of
happiness as an emotion by positive events (Csikszentmihalyi, & Hunter, 2003). These
positive events mostly involve activities that are freely chosen and that include the company
of peers, whereas activities where the individual has no freedom of choice such as school
work lower the level of happiness (Csikszentmihalyi, & Hunter, 2003). Additionally,
happiness can also be positively influenced by small events such as „finding a dime on a copy
machine“ (Schwartz & Strack, 1999). Therefore, also seemingly small events can have a
significant influence on us.
 Trait happiness on the other hand, is described as the propensity to experience positive
affect with a continuous and frequent production of pleasant events (Veenhoven, 1998).
Therefore, in order to be a trait temporal stability, cross-situational consistency, and inner
causation need to be present in an individuals repertoire (Veenhoven, 2005). With regard to
the Top-Down approach, this means that a person is prone to enjoy things more positively and
thus enjoys pleasure which results in happiness, instead of happiness resulting because of the
sum of small pleasures (Furnham & Cheng, 2000). So, happiness as a stable personality trait
has an influence on how a person reacts to an event, namely with continuous elevated levels
of state happiness (Furnham & Cheng, 2000).
Anger and Happiness
 Regarding the relation between anger and happiness, there have not been many studies
that researched the association of these two constructs. Nevertheless, some studies conducted
ANGER & HAPPINESS 7
research on the relationship between anger and psychological wellbeing, of which happiness
serves as a component (Kim-Prieto et al., 2005). In this context, higher levels of anger
expression were related to lower levels of psychological well-being (Diong & Bishop, 1999).
So, a person that is expressing anger consistently through physical and verbal aggression is
related to lower psychological well-being and lower life satisfaction (Howard et al., 2010).
This kind of anger expression is commonly found among men, whereas women engage more
in behaviors such as retreating or giving the silent treatment. (Howard et al., 2010).
 The expression of anger in this aggressive fashion consequently might impair
relationships and impede career progress, which in turn again lowers the satisfaction of life
(Howard et al., 2010). Thus, life satisfaction correlates in the negative direction with anger
(Howard et al., 2010). This relation was also found by Hong and Giannakopoulos (1994), who
state that lower anger levels are related to higher life satisfaction and vice versa. Nonetheless,
there is also a positive effect of anger on satisfaction with life, namely the creation of a
positive basis for communication and an energizing effect in life (Hong & Giannakopoulos,
1994).
The Current Study
 This study aims to investigate the relationship between the state and trait levels of
anger and happiness to provide an overview of the associations in one study. Especially, the
relationship between trait and trait, trait and state and state and state of anger and happiness
will be investigated. Consequently, the two of these constructs will be examined on their
association on a daily basis. Based on previous findings in emotion research, it is
hypothesised that the two constructs of trait anger and trait happiness have a negative
relationship (Hong & Giannakopoulos, 1994). In this case, individuals that experience angry
emotions feel less happy and individuals that feel happy experience less angry emotions on a
regular basis.
 Additionally, the current study aims to investigate on the state or trait nature of the
relationship between anger and happiness. Here, it is hypothesised that higher levels of trait
anger are associated with lower levels of state happiness, hence expecting a negative
relationship (Quinn et al., 2014). Moreover, a negative association is predicted regarding the
relationship between trait happiness and state anger (Furnham & Cheng, 2000). Granted that
ANGER & HAPPINESS 8
these associations are negative, higher levels of trait happiness would be associated with less
experience of state anger and vice versa. Furthermore, a negative relationship between state
anger and state happiness is expected, resulting in a decrease of anger when happiness
increases and vice versa (Martin et al., 2013). Consequently, based on the previous
predictions, several hypotheses (H) can be derived for the study:
H1: The emotions of trait anger and trait happiness have a negative relationship towards
 each other.
H2: There is a negative relationship between trait anger and average state happiness.
H3: Trait happiness has a negative association with average state anger.
H4: State anger and state happiness have a negative relationship with regard to their
 average and momentary levels.
Methods
Design
To measure individuals’ daily experiences over the course of one week, the method of
experience sampling was utilised. Furthermore, individuals’ cross-sectional data was
compared with their longitudinal data. The Behavioural, Management, and Social Sciences
(BMS) Ethics Committee of the University of Twente granted ethical approval for the data
collection of the study in 2020.
Participants
 The Test Subject Pool SONA of the University of Twente was used for the purpose of
recruiting participants by using a convenience sampling method. In addition, the survey was
distributed via several social media platforms such as Whatsapp. Participants that took part
via SONA received an incentive of one credit as compensation for their efforts, whereas
participants who did not partake via the SONA System did not receive any compensation. In
order to participate in this study, a smartphone able to download the app Ethica was needed
and partaking individuals needed to be at least 18 years old. Participants with incomplete data
and outside the range of young adults between 18 to 30 (Duggan & Brenner, 2013; Pelling &
White, 2009) were excluded from the sample. The final dataset consisted of a sample size of
ANGER & HAPPINESS 9
31 young adults (Male = 23%, Female = 77%) in the age range of 19 to 25 (M = 21.25, SD =
1.34) after cleaning the original sample based on the exclusion criteria mentioned above.
Moreover, the study consisted mostly of German students (German = 30, Other = 1) (Fulltime Student = 18, Part-time Student and Part-time Working = 11 , Other = 2). Individuals
participated by agreeing to the informed consent and on a voluntary basis in the current study.
Materials
This online survey was created with the online survey tool Ethica which is especially
suited for smartphone use. Because of the present study being part of a more extensive
research, the total test battery included six daily state items and four trait questionnaires.
Nevertheless, for the purpose of the current study, only questionnaires related to anger and
happiness were used (see Measures).
Ethica
Ethica (ethicadata.com) is an online survey tool that focuses on smartphones which
run on Android or iOS for collecting scientific data. It can be used to construct different
questionnaires using different functions of the platform as a researcher or to partake in studies
as participant. The online tool is especially suited for experience sampling due to its mobile
use as an app and its trigger mechanism, which enables data collection at several times a day
over the course of multiple days. Regarding the current study, participants received
notifications to complete a survey on four timeframes per day over seven consecutive days,
which enabled the collection of sufficient amount of data.
Procedure
To join the study, participants had to either sign up for the study on SONA or join via
the participation link on social media. Subsequently, they needed to download Ethica on their
phone and create a participant account by using their email address and a password. Next,
they had to insert the specific participation code to find the study and join it. Participants got
all the necessary information for their participation, like a consent form, contact details of the
researchers, and general information about the study. The participants were informed about
the procedure of the study, for instance, that the app will send them notifications as soon as a
ANGER & HAPPINESS 10
survey is ready to be completed, to turn on their notifications on their phones, and what to
expect the next few days. Next, demographics including age, gender, nationality, and
occupation were requested, followed by an assessment of the trait domains of happiness and
anger.
On the consecutive seven days, measurements were made on four occasions per day.
The questionnaires were triggered between 9-10 am, 12-1 pm, 4-5 pm, and 8-9 pm. For every
short survey, the participants received a notification that the survey is ready for them to be
completed. After 30 minutes, they received a second reminder that a new survey was
available. If the participants did not answer the survey within the intended timeframe, it
automatically expired 60 minutes after the first notification. On the last day (day 8), the
participants received a final notification after answering the last questionnaire. This
notification stated that this was the end of the study and thanked the participants for their
participation. Students that participated via SONA received their one credit point subsequent
to the end of the study as compensation for their efforts.
Measures
Trait Questionnaires
Trait Happiness. In order to assess the participants’ levels of trait happiness, the
happiness subscale out of the Abridged Five Factor Circumplex Model (AB5C) was used
(Bäckström et al., 2009; Mitchelson et al., 2009). There were ten items, which were to be
answered on a five-point Likert-Scale ranging from 1 ”very inaccurate” to 5 ”very accurate”.
Five out of ten items were reverse code scale items. Items included for example “I feel
comfortable with myself” and “I feel threatened easily”. Regarding psychometric properties,
the subscale shows good internal consistency (α = .84) and acceptable structural validity
(Bäckström et al., 2009).
Trait Anger. The Aggression Questionnaire by Buss and Perry (1992) is divided into
the four subscales of physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility. The present
study only used the subscale of Anger. This subscale consists of seven items in total and was
measured with a five- point Likert-Scale ranging from 1 ”extremely uncharacteristic of me” to
5 ”extremely characteristic of me”. The total score of the seven items ranges from a minimum
of seven to a maximum of 35. Higher scores indicate a higher level of anger (Buss & Perry,
ANGER & HAPPINESS 11
1992). Regarding psychometric properties, the subscale showed good reliability and validity,
with internal consistency from .72 to .88 and Cronbach’s alpha scores from .83 to .91. Its testretest reliability also showed good scores with .72 (Hornsveld et al., 2008).
State Questionnaires
State Happiness. To investigate the state component of happiness, one item was
designed by the researcher. This was done because no questionnaires referring to state
happiness, initially designed for experience sampling, had been proposed yet. For state
happiness, the item included “I feel happy at the moment”. The item was to be answered on a
five-point Likert-Scale from 1 “very inaccurate” to 5 “very accurate”. As this item was selfmade, there have not yet been investigations concerning the psychometric properties.
State Anger. State anger was measured by using the items “I am mad right now” and
“I feel irritated right now”. The items were answered using a five- point Likert scale from 1
”Not at all“ to 5 ”Very much so”. Previous studies that also used single or a small set of
multiple questions included very similar items compared to the two used in the current study
(Borders & Lu, 2016; Fresnics & Borders, 2016; Hamdan-Mansour et al., 2012). There have
not yet been investigations concerning the psychometric properties of these self-made items.
Data Analysis
For the data analysis IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 25.0) was used. First, the collected
data was cleaned by excluding participants younger than the age of 18 and participants with
incomplete data from the dataset. Second, a factor analysis was done on the state and trait
items of anger as well as state and trait items of happiness, in order to test their construct
validity. Third, descriptive statistics and their means, standard deviations, skewness and
kurtosis values for the variables of trait anger, trait happiness, state anger and state happiness
were calculated. These values provide insight into the normality in data distribution. If there
were values beyond the cut off points of -2 and 2 for skewness and -7 and 7 for kurtosis
(Byrne, 2010), additional Q-Q plots were performed in order to inspect the normal
distribution visually. Next, a reliability analysis was done for the trait questionnaires AB5C
and the Aggression Questionnaire to test their internal consistency by calculating Cronbach’s
ANGER & HAPPINESS 12
Alpha. Here, values >.9 are interpreted as excellent, >.8 as good, >.7 as acceptable, >.6 as
questionable, >.5 as poor and <.5 as unacceptable (Gliem & Gliem, 2003).
In order to test the hypotheses (see Introduction), multilevel analyses were performed
for every hypothesis individually. For the present study, a correlation is considered significant
when its p-value is lower than .05. Moreover, to run the analysis the average state anger and
state happiness levels were calculated by identifying person mean scores (PM). This was done
by aggregating the mean of the data per person. By calculating the PM score, the multilevel
analysis accounts for between-person differences. Additionally, for each participant person
mean-centred scores (PM-centred) were calculated in order to analyse within-person
differences regarding state anger and state happiness. The PM-centred scores were calculated
by subtracting the aggregate variable from the original state variable (Curran & Bauer, 2011).
Results
The missing values of participants at 111 of 850 timepoints have been imputed with
the median of the respective variable. The reason for choosing the median was the
overarching stability compared to the mean.
Testing for Normality
Descriptive statistics and their means, standard deviations, skewness and kurtosis
values for the variables of trait anger, trait happiness, state anger and state happiness were
also calculated. These values provide a good insight into the normality in data distribution.
The skewness and kurtosis values indicate a normal distribution of the sample regarding the
state and trait questionnaires, since these scores did not exceed the cut off points of -2 and 2
for skewness and -7 and 7 for kurtosis (see Table 1) (Byrne, 2010).
 By comparing the means of the scales to their minimum and maximum scores (see
Table 1), there is a tendency towards happier individuals in the trait happiness scale, a
tendency towards slight more anger in the trait anger scale, no tendency in any direction on
PM state happiness and a tendency towards less anger on PM state anger. It can therefore be
concluded that the sample shows lower levels in anger in state and trait and higher levels in
happiness in state and trait.

Factor Analysis
A factor analysis with the extraction method of maximum likelihood was conducted
for the three self-developed state items and the trait items of anger and happiness, to establish
its preliminary construct validity. Factors were extracted according to the „a priori“ criterion.
This criterion suggests factors based on the theoretical structure of the items used, for instance
state items and trait items should therefore measure their respective constructs. Additionally, a
Varimax rotation was applied for the sake of clarity concerning the factor loadings. Regarding
the first factor, the trait happiness items generally confirm a common construct with two
exceptions namely, item 4 ”Look at the bright side of life“ and item 10 ”Am filled with doubts
about things” from the trait happiness scale. The second factor also confirms a common
structure across the states. Similarly, for the third factor trait anger items generally confirm a
common construct with the exception of item 5 ”Some of my friends think I’m a hothead“ and
item 6 ”Sometimes I fly off the handle for no good reason” from the trait anger scale, which
loaded on the fourth and first factor respectively. The fourth factor however appears to be a
rather random factor with the fourth item of the trait happiness scale and the fifth item of the

Extraction Method: Maximum Likelihood.
Reliability Analysis
 In order to test the reliability of the two trait scales with regard to few of their items
loading on different constructs, a reliability analysis was conducted. Additionally, running a
reliability analysis gives insight into possible changes in Cronbach’s alpha if suspicious items
get excluded from their respective scale (see Appendix Table 1 & Table 2). The internal
consistency of the trait anger scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of .78 in the current study.
Excluding items from the scale which loaded on another factor (items 5 & 6) did not result in
a change or only in a slight positive change of Cronbach’s alpha, namely by excluding item 5
(see Appendix Table 1).
The internal consistency of the trait happiness scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of .84 in
the current study, which is even with the reported Cronbach’s alpha by Bäckström et al.
(2009). In this case, excluding item 4 and 10 of the scale due to them loading on another
factor results in no change or a slight decrease of Cronbach’s alpha in the case of item 10 (see
Appendix Table 2).
Correlations
A significant negative correlation has been found between state anger and state
happiness (r = -.73, p < .001). Therefore, it is assumed that individuals who have higher state

anger levels, experience lover levels of state happiness and vice versa. In tendency, there were
no significant correlations between the variables implying that there is not much
multicollinearity. The only variables that significantly correlated with each other were state
anger and state happiness.

Multilevel Analysis
In order to answer the hypotheses, a conceptual model was tested. A linear mixed
model was calculated in order to draw inferences about the different hypotheses, except the
first hypothesis for which a linear regression analysis was used. The first analysis, was
conducted with trait happiness as dependent variable and trait anger as independent variable.
Results indicated that trait anger was not associated with trait happiness (b = -.32, t(31) =
-1.61, p = .117).
The analysis for the second hypothesis was conducted with trait anger as independent
variable and state happiness (PM) as dependent variable. Results showed that state happiness
(PM) was no significant variable for trait happiness in the model (b = -.01, t(31) = 1.18, p =
.245).

decrease in .29 points in state happiness. Results of the between-person analysis indicated
state anger as being a significant variable for state happiness in the model, b = -.43, t(849) =
-31.68, p < .001. An increase in one unit in the standard deviation of state anger leads to a
decrease in .43 points in state happiness.

Discussion
General Discussion
The current study aimed to study the relationship between the emotions of happiness
and anger on a trait and state level. The overall results found in the present study indicate that
individuals tend to be stable in their situational (state) emotions regarding the possible
influence of their personality (trait) emotions, while situational emotions tend to be influenced
by other situational emotions and thus fluctuate.
 The first hypothesis, stating a negative relationship of trait anger and trait happiness
was not supported. This finding is not in line with previous research which found an existing
negative relationship (Hong & Giannakopoulos, 1994). This difference may be explained by
age and study population differences, with older people being generally less angry than young
people (Schieman, 1999) and men expressing their anger more compared to the current papers
majority of female respondents, who tend to cover their anger up (Timmers et al., 1998).
Nevertheless, anger and happiness were also found to have no relationship (Schwartz &
Weinberger, 1980), thus implying ambiguous results in the literature. This ambiguity could be
explained by differences in sample characteristics and sizes.
Next, the second hypothesis about a negative relationship between trait anger and
average state happiness was not supported. Previous research referred high trait anger to
lower self-esteem, perception of lower social support, prone of having suicidal ideation and
alienation from school or university (Quinn et al., 2014), whereas state happiness was related
to activities which include social environments (company of peers) (Csikszentmihalyi, &
Hunter, 2003). Also, it was found that activities with no freedom of choice like school work
decrease one’s happiness level (Csikszentmihalyi, & Hunter, 2003). Therefore, this
additionally supports the aspect of alienation from school or university in higher trait anger
and reinforces the claim about a negative relationship between trait anger and state happiness.
Nonetheless, results showed a floor effect with a tendency towards lower trait and state anger
levels throughout the sample, while results of happiness imply a tendency towards higher
levels in trait and state across the sample. Subsequently, this distribution is in line with the
definition of happiness as the presence of positive affect (higher happiness levels) and the
absence of negative affect (lower anger levels) (Demır & Weitekamp, 2006). Nevertheless,
ANGER & HAPPINESS 19
there was no relationship between these two constructs, implying that they lie on two separate
dimensions independently from each other.
The third hypothesis, predicting a negative association between trait happiness and
average state anger could also not be supported. Here, the same topic is in question as in the
second hypothesis, namely whether trait and state like emotions are in their entirety
independent from another or if this only applies for the constructs of anger and happiness. As
research has found, state anger is influenced by trait anger (Quinn et al., 2014) and trait
happiness has an influence on state happiness (Furnham & Cheng, 2000). Neither of these
trait to state relationships within anger and within happiness could be found in the current
study, which might also explain why there was no support of a trait to state relationship across
anger and happiness. With regard to the state-trait model (Spielberger et al., 1983), the results
show no support, as they do not imply a reinforcement of anger and neither of happiness in
individuals with high levels of their respective emotion. In contrast, the distribution of anger
and happiness across the sample again is in favour of an increase in happiness of individuals
with high levels, due to higher happiness levels and lower anger levels, thus supporting the
state-trait model (Spielberger et al., 1983).
Finally, the fourth hypothesis regarding a negative relationship between state anger
and state happiness on average and momentary levels was supported. This emphasises present
fluctuations between the emotions of anger and happiness on a state level, because results
show that in momentary experiences of anger or happiness individuals are able to get
influenced in an either emotionally happier or angrier state. Furthermore, this finding is in line
with previous research presenting similar findings, thus being in support of a negative
relationship between the states of anger and happiness (Martin et al., 2013). With regard to
state anger correlating strongly with increased aggression, aggressive behaviour and risky
behaviour (Deffenbacher et al., 2003; Gordon et al., 2016) and state happiness being
associated with lower levels of stress (Schiffrin & Nelson, 2010) through more adaptive
coping styles (Rim, 1993), it can be deduced that these emotions, which increase and decrease
stress, indicate a negative relationship.
 Moreover, with happy individuals having a higher satisfaction with life, they are
inclined to being warm, having a positive self view and not being anxious or critical in
interpersonal relations (Emmons & Diener, 1985). This stands in contrast to angers previously
ANGER & HAPPINESS 20
mentioned association to mental disorders such as bipolar disorder, borderline and paranoid
personality disorder (DiGiuseppe & Tafrate, 2007) where individuals do not maintain a
positive self view and are anxious in interpersonal relations. Thus, this underlines the negative
relationship on a deeper level between state anger and state happiness. On the one hand, these
attributes come on trait levels of anger and happiness, but on the other hand they also apply to
their state levels by previous research findings, explaining an influence of trait anger and
happiness on state anger and happiness (Quinn et al., 2014; Furnham & Cheng, 2000).
Factor Analysis Implications
 Regarding the factor analysis, a fourth unknown factor appeared, on which some of
the items loaded. With the fourth and tenth item of the trait happiness scale and the fifth item
of the trait anger scale, three items loaded on this unknown factor. Potential reason for this
could be that these items correlated the highest with each other, implying that those items
interact with each other more than with the rest of the scale. This unknown factor could
represent a depressive factor with items loading on it asking the participant about negative
cognitions (“Am filled with doubts about things“), negative misinterpretations (“Some of my
friends think I’m a hothead”) and about one’s (negative) perception of life (“Look at the
bright side of life”). These categories are in line with Beck’s formulation of the cognitive triad
in depression, which can be transformed into the expectations a person has. Namely
expectations of negative outcomes regarding the self, negative expectations about others and
negative expectations about future events (Rief & Joormann, 2019).
 Moreover, the sixth item of trait anger loaded on the first factor, on which all trait
happiness items loaded. An explanation could be that the item interacts more with trait
happiness than trait anger. Nonetheless, excluding the sixth item of trait anger from its scale
did not strengthen or improve the accuracy of the scale to measure anger. Additionally, both
state emotions loaded on the one common factor, which at first was unexpected. Nonetheless,
this seems reasonable as high anger implies lower states of happiness.
Societal Implications
 Through the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus in 2019, the data of this study
was collected during this global pandemic. As a result of governmental regulations to deal
with the spread of the virus, people around the world had to adapt their lifestyles by social
ANGER & HAPPINESS 21
distancing, reducing social contacts and social activities. Therefore, a decrease in happiness
scores was expected in the current study. In line with this expectation, it was found that high
levels of perceived risk regarding COVID-19 can decrease one’s level of happiness (Yıldırım
& Güler, 2020).
 Additionally, the possibility of anger increasing in individuals due to restrictions and
lifestyle changes is also a realistic consequence of the global pandemic. Previous research
supports this consequence by stating that lockdowns and characteristics of the pandemic,
which include uncertainty, social isolation and worries about one’s health could increase
anger levels of individuals (Shanahan et al., 2020). Thus, it is important to assess the state and
trait levels of individuals when they are engaging in their everyday life activities again, such
as participating in social activities (Menec, 2003). Resulting deviations from the norm
regarding the scores of anger and happiness can lead to a strong impact on the inferences
drawn from the data. For instance, individuals with no clinical diagnosis of depression
showed an increase in depressive symptoms during the pandemic, therefore implying towards
decreased happiness (Pan et al., 2020).
Practical Implications
The current findings, can further contribute to practice in clinical care and accordingly
to existing interventions focusing on anger and happiness emotions. Through interventions
over a day that focus on a decrease in state anger, individuals’ situational happiness can be
positively influenced. Moreover, future intervention designs could also aim at reducing the
frequent experience of anger emotions and increasing the frequency of happiness emotions by
future research investigating the direction of the state anger and state happiness relationship.
 Such interventions would largely benefit the practice in clinical care, which would be
suited to individuals with mental disorders such as bipolar disorder, borderline or antisocial
personality disorder where individuals tend to have higher levels of anger (DiGiuseppe &
Tafrate, 2007). In the treatment with such clients, it would be beneficial to lower their anger
levels with the help of interventions that target these emotions. Especially in bipolar disorder,
manic phases would benefit from anger reduction and depressive phases would benefit from
an increase in happiness emotions.

Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research
 Limitations in the present study should be considered when interpreting the results.
First, the present study demonstrated an overrepresentation of females in the sample (77%).
This overrepresentation affects the generalisability and representativeness of the findings
about anger and happiness to the population of young adults. The overrepresentation of one
gender is important to consider in generalisability and representativeness of the findings
because males and females respond differently on anger. More specifically, expression
differences in anger account for men to be more likely to express their anger and for women
to be more likely to cover their anger up (Timmers et al., 1998). In order to avoid this
limitation and to ensure more valid generalisability and representativeness, future studies
should strive for an even sample in their target population regarding gender.
 Second, the study population included solely young adults with a student majority.
This limitation is to bear in mind because of anger and age having a negative relationship
(Schieman, 1999). This means that the older people get, the less angry they generally become.
Thus, this can lead to different findings which can result in future studies in this field by using
differently aged samples. Therefore, in order to allow for representativeness for the general
population, future studies should aim for inclusion of several age groups in their sample.
 Third, the present study assessed individuals’ state levels of anger and happiness by
self-constructed scales. Next to being self-constructed, the scales consisted of two items or of
being a single item scale, which makes them very short. These two aspects make it difficult to
state how reliable the measurement constructs were and therefore, whether future studies will
find similar results using these state anger and state happiness scales. Future research is
therefore endorsed to run a pilot test or several rounds of revision, in order to determine
sufficient reliability (Tay & Jebb, 2017).
 Furthermore, a recommendation for future research in this field using the experience
sampling method is to conduct a dropout analysis of participants of the sample. Dropouts of a
survey can be generally described as respondents who quit the study without fully completing
the survey. Here, a dropout analysis can help to find possible reasons for the dropout in order
to improve the survey. Improvements can result in enhancing the survey questions or the
overall length of the study. Moreover, such analysis can provide insight as to which questions
or which timepoints were responsible for the maximum amount of respondents leaving and
ANGER & HAPPINESS 23
thus, the flow of the survey can be improved. Considering the emotion of anger, it could lead
to more insight if angrier individuals are prone to prematurely quit the study. In previous
research, trait anger more than state anger, meaning angry temperament more than situational
angry emotions has been found to lead to the interruption of treatment of such individuals
(Fassino et al., 2003).
Additionally, with state anger and state happiness being negatively associated, future
research is recommended to examine the direction of this relationship, as the present study
cannot draw inferences about causality. Hereby, measurement which lasts over a longer time
period than one week can be helpful in receiving clearer and more representative results. With
the knowledge about causality, interventions can profit more in their design to specifically
target emotions like anger or happiness in order to achieve a decrease or increase the
situational levels of these emotions. Also, there is the opportunity for future research to use
this study design and apply it to other emotional traits and states as well, in order to gain a
complete picture including many different emotions.
Conclusion
 Following the state-trait model, the current study contributes to the literature on
understanding anger and happiness with the relationships in their trait and state levels.
Specifically, combining trait to trait, trait to state and state to state relationships together in
one study accounts for a novelty in the research field about the emotions of anger and
happiness. With the current study being able to confirm a negative state to state relationship
between anger and happiness compared to the other mentioned possible relationships, it is
recommended to examine the direction of this relationship, with an even sample regarding
gender and the inclusion of several age groups. The investigation of these emotional
fluctuations is important and needs attention in order to prevent negative consequences on
individuals’ mental health.
